Animation on the web should be done with CSS and not JavaScript.

JavaScript is powerful and versatile tool.  And that's good, because it's all web developers have to work with.  Especially [now](http://weblog.bocoup.com/javascript-arduino-programming-with-nodejs/) [that](https://github.com/charliesome/jsos/) [it's](https://github.com/grantgalitz/GameBoy-Online) [everywhere](http://nodejs.org/), we're really lucky that JavaScript is so flexible.  We live in kind of a strange reality where there's almost nothing that JavaScript _can't_ do that another language can.  However, it's kind of like a [multitool](http://www.multitool.org/) â€” it can do everything but it doesn't really excel at anything.  Certain situations call for specialized tools, and animation is one of those.

At first blush, animation doesn't seem like a "style" in the same sense that `border-radius` is a style.  The taxonomy is a little broken, but so it goes with technology.  CSS3 affords us APIs and performance that will eventually let us bring the web to life with interfaces that would make [Minority Report](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwVBzx0LMNQ) jealous.  This article discusses how to optimize for performance and eye-catching motion.
