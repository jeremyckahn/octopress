I absolutely love open source.  It's something that is fascinating on many levels, and it's also a ton of fun.  Depending on who you talk to, "open source" can mean a great many things.  At the core, open source is public access to computer source code.  Interestingly, this access has created religion-esque alliances and discords within communities for decades.  For my part, I am strongly on the side of open.  I initially became interested because it's fun to share code.  Over time, I further developed my beliefs and examined my motivations.  I have come to believe that open source is what's best for society on a global level.  I think it's important to be "open sourcey."

## What is "being open sourcey?"

Since I'm inventing a term, I should probably define it.  Being open sourcey means being a developer that writes open source code, while also working with the developer community to improve existing code and solve problems.

Writing code is just one, fairly small component of this.  Software development is heavily maintenance-oriented, and typing out code is actually a pretty trivial task.  The bigger challenge is iterating and improving code over time to meet new requirements while also fulfilling the original set of requirements.  Interestingly, this becomes exponentially more challenging over time, and it quickly becomes too much work for one person.

World changing code is _never_ written by one person.  World changing ideas may come from one person, but actual implementations are always the result of an organized and collaborative effort shared between many smart people.  Linus Torvalds did not write the entirety of the Linux kernel that is in use today, and John Resig did not write every line of the jQuery that we use today.  It takes one person to come up with an idea, but it takes a community to execute on it.
