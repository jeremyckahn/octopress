I love experimenting with application architecture and organization.  I build applications for fun, and each one gives me a chance to try out a new method for keeping a growing codebase manageable and readable.  I try to mix it up a but with each new project, but a number of consistent patterns have emerged and proven themselves useful time and again.

The same is true of my toolset.  I have come to really enjoy two libraries in particular - Backbone and Require.js.  Each one does one thing and does it well: Backbone organizes an application, and Require.js gets code onto the page.  What makes these libraries great is that they are not heavy-handed solutions - as long as you know how to use them, they don't lock you into some weird pattern that makes your code inflexible.

That being said, knowing how to use Backbone and Require.js is a discipline.  Without a consistent pattern to follow, even a small Backbone app can grow unmanageable and hard to build upon.  The patterns I'll discuss here are designed to grow with your app and make your life easier.

## Keeping it real small


## Required bootstrapping


## Backbone boilerplating


## Narrow Views
