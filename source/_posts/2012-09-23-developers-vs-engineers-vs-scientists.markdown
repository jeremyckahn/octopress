I've been programming professionally for about 3 years at this point, and I've noticed some interesting patterns amongst other programmers I've worked with.  One of the key differentiators amongst programmers is _motivation_.  I'm not referring to an individual's fervor to simply be successful in their career, but rather the path that they want their career to take.  The thing they want to do with computers every day, the types of problems they are interested in solving.

The programmers I have observed generally fall into one of three categories: Developers, engineers, and computer scientists (or just "scientists").  These are not silos.  They are ranges on a spectrum, and programmers can often find themselves wavering all over this spectrum throughout the course of a day.  However, individuals are usually more comfortable in one of these ranges than the others.

It's important to make something very clear at the outset: The categories I describe here _do not_ imply differentiating levels of aptitude or intelligence.  A developer can be every bit as "smart" as a computer scientist, it's the motivating spark that sets programmers apart.


## Developers

Developers want to get things done.  They are the prototypers, the guns for hire, the guys you can trust to get something workable by the end of the day.  Developers love to keep up on the latest jQuery plugins and Ruby Gems, always learning the newest tool that will solve their problems faster.  Developers are especially useful for building websites in deadline-driven environments.  From a business perspective, you want someone who can hack something together without getting bogged down in technical minutiae.  As for starting a programming career, "developers" face the lowest barrier of entry.

Developers run into trouble when their tools don't stop working.  When the JavaScript library they've been using suddenly doesn't meet project requirements exactly, they often have to resort to strange workarounds and code comments like `/* DON'T TOUCH THIS!! */`, rather than gaining a comprehensive understanding of the problem and why their solution works.  At least as far as this definition is concerned, a developer's knowledge area is a mile wide and a meter deep.


## Engineers

Engineers are interested in the mastery of a problem domain.  Engineers don't settle for solutions that "just work," they dig until they have an understanding of the big picture.  They focus on reusable solutions that scale, elegant architectures, and building tools to automate their work.  Engineers are useful for designing unique solutions for unique problems.  Engineers prefer to write and maintain the Ruby Gems that developers find themselves learning and using.

Engineers are sometimes more interested in building solutions than they are in actually solving problems.  Rookie engineers in particular will spend a lot of time solving problems they may never have, because it is an interesting challenge.  If you are managing engineers, it is important to keep them focused on practical tasks, rather than unrestrained experimentation and exploration.  That's what their Github hobby projects are for.


## Scientists

Computer Scientists live in a world of theory and are the most likely to advance the state of the art.  These are the optimization freaks, the algorithm masterminds, the Big Data herders.  Depending on what you are trying to build, scientists are indispensable.  They build solutions for the problems that most people don't understand.

At least in my experience, computer scientists aren't the best builders.  While they construct the most efficient and "pure" solutions, they may not write the most readable code or maintainable systems.  Since they are in the minority that actually understands certain complex problems, knowledge transfer becomes a problem.  Even with good documentation, it can be difficult to get inside the head of a scientist that has been working out a solution for several weeks.

The skill set of a scientist has a lot of overlap with that of an engineer.  I would argue that these groups are differentiated by a focus on theory versus implementation.  Scientists focus on theory, and engineers focus on actual implementations.  The programmer with a good mix of science and engineering is a true phenom and an invaluable asset.


# It takes all kinds

A truly effective team consists of all three of these types of programmers.  A good baseball team leverages the strengths of each of its players, and development team is no different.  For my own part, I find myself most comfortable near the "engineer" range of the programmer spectrum, but I often venture into the "developer" range for various tasks.  I identify myself as a "scientist" less often, but it becomes necessary from time to time.  The point is, programmers flit all around the spectrum, but tend to gravitate towards one range more than others.  Balance your team according to what you want to build.
