Small functions are better than large functions.  This is something that I've found to be consistently true in my programming work, both in my day job as well as my open source projects.  There are many advantages to keeping functions small and simple, and most of them revolve around maintainability.  Being able to work with code without losing your mind is something that I personally find very important and interesting, but there are many other benefits to being conservative with function size.

## Readability

## Code reuse

## Flexibility

## Reframing functions

(Why we have functions.  They define an API, they aren't just code containers.)
